Make a really cool looking website with Flask for AIWL. 

The home page should persuasively express a vision for how AI has the opportunity to revolutionize education and innovation across the world, especially in developing countries. It should also state our mission and preface the trip to Cameroon. Finally, it should appeal for donations to fund the laptops and the trip.

There should be an about us page that has personal info about Rylin and Paul, what motivated us to start this organization, and what we hope to accomplish.

There should be a donate page that has a form for people to donate to the cause. We are currently in the process of setting up a PayPal for non-profits account, and we will embed a donation form into the website.
